## About Me

This is a project that builds a website that's about me. I explored basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the webiste. I also have a very brief intro for my work experience and a bit about myself, I am hoping to add more features to my website to make it look prettier!

### Reflections and Comments

- Day1: This website was made without any functions, so it was very tedious to write when there were repeated `if` statements. This project made me really apprecate using functions.
- Day2: Today is a loop-day, it really threw me into a loop... I was doing everything fine using the includes() method in JS, but since it was not allowed, I spent over 2 hours trying to figure out how to use loops for it instead. I did learn a new way to validate something, though. It was by setting a variable to false initially then turn it to true if the condition is met. Then everything else just runs according to the boolean variable, it worked great!
