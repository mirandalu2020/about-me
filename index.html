    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
    Hi, my name is Miranda and I am a recent graduate with a bachelor's degree in Chemistry. Besides college, I once worked as a welder, a helicopter mechanic, and a business administrator. After completing my degree, I realized that neither medical school or the lab life was for me, so I decided to leverage my quantitaive reasoning skills to enter the analytics field, and I believe coding is a powerful tool in data analytics.

    Although I no longer intend to pursue Chemistry as a career, I use the knowledge from the subject on a daily-basis. I learned how to bake bread by reading scientific journals about the change of gluten interactions under different environments. I researched observed gluten behaviors under different pH, temperature, oil content, and hydrations levels, and experimented in my kitchen accordingly to find the "perfect recipe." My most recent results were applied to make a perfect Chicao style deep dish pizza crust, and it was great success! Since no one can say no to a good slice of pizza, the following is a list of my favorite pizza toppings:
